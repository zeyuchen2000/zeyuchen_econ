                    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
                        Serial notes on models. <em>Remarks:</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This series of notes focuses on models. I start with some trade models, which typically serve as the baseline to depict specific causes of the formation of trade and labor division. These notes draw a lot from notes written by Allen and Arkolakis for reference. Their notes, available at <a href="https://arkolakis.com/wp-content/uploads/ClassNotes.pdf" target="_blank">[notes link]</a>, are very useful materials for researchers. I then quickly shift to more recent, influential spatial models incorporating labor mobility and additional institutional contexts.</li>
                            <li>I also recommend readers to read Section 2 of "Quantitative Spatial Economics" (Redding and Rossi-Hansberg, 2017, <em>Annual Review of Economics</em>), available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-economics-063016-103713" target="_blank">[paper link]</a>, to learn how to choose the building blocks of a spatial model according to our research topic.</li>
                            <li>Typically, the migration block of a spatial model relies on a discrete choice model. Because of this, researchers would likely find training in these models very beneficial. Furthermore, current urban models often necessitate estimating consumer demand, making training in demand estimation equally crucial. Some useful materials can be found in the "Empirical IO" column below.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <em>Notes:</em>

                            <li>Trade shaped by productivity variation: trade models with heterogeneous firms (from Ricardo to DFS to EK). <a href="notes/qse/model/EK.pdf" target="_blank">[notes]</a></li>

MATLAB code written by the authors is also available at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdu035" target="_blank">[paper link]</a>. I've also attached my own (incomplete) Python replication here: <a href="notes/qse/model/rep_CP2015.zip" target="_blank">[replication files]</a>.</li>

                            <li>Spatial model in Chinese context: "Trade, Migration, and Productivity: A Quantitative Analysis of China" (Tombe and Zhu, 2019, <em>AER</em>) (simplified CP2015 + ARSW2015 + Chinese context). <a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20150811" target="_blank">[paper link]</a> | <a href="notes/qse/model/TZ2019.pdf" target="_blank">[notes]</a> <br/>Readers, especially those interested in Chinese topics, might consider replicating this paper's code after replicating CP2015, as it solves a static spatial model (incorporating both trade and migration) yet isn't overly complicated. Authors' code is available at <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113071/version/V1/view" target="_blank">[code link]</a>. Once this replication is complete, I believe you'll be able to write and solve your own static spatial model.</li>

                            <li>This paper offers a highly accessible introduction to the BLP framework, complete with sample code for solving the model. While there is now a well-established Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyblp/" target="_blank">PyBLP</a>, that implements more advanced algorithms, working through the original approach still offers valuable insight into the core principles of the BLP method and its foundational algorithm.

The appendix is particularly valuable as it walks through the estimation steps in detail.

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>When deciding to use asymptotic inference, it is recommended to use asymptotic standard errors calculated from jackknife (leave-one-out) method when sample size is small, since it has better small-sample properties (it is unbiased) and is relatively conservative.</li>
                                        <li>As the sample size increases, there seems to be a lower bound on the shrinkage of the cluster-robust standard error, and thus the underestimation of the standard error due to ignoring the clustered structure becomes increasingly larger. (In other words, it is more necessary to treat clustered structure carefully when the sample size is large.)</li>
                                        <li>When using DD estimates, it is important to cluster at least to the geographic level where the treatment is assigned.</li>
                                        <li>If the number of treatment clusters are small, don't use asymptotic cluster-robust standard errors but use wide-cluster bootstrap standard errors.</li>
                                        <li>In the vast majority of cases, adding fixed effects is not the reason for not clustering.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            There are two rules of thumb to decide the cluster level:
                                            <ol type="i">
                                                <li>An intuitive rule: to choose the most coarse one among all possible levels, up to the point at which there is concern about having too few clusters</li>
                                                <li>A conservative rule: to report the largest standard error for the coefficient of interest across all estimated at varying possible cluster levels.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>There are some pre-tests that are helpful in deciding the cluster level, but pre-tests always lead to over-reject because they in and of themselves could make mistakes. Therefore, The ideal procedure is to cluster based on the second rule of thumb and use pre-tests to further support the choice.</li>
                                        <li>The permutation test ("placebo test") commonly used in DD estimation (especially in Chinese literature) is used to support the statistic inference rather than the causal identification.</li>
                                        <li>The asymptotic inference relies on the central limit theorem (CLT). The number of clusters and the heterogeneity among clusters both determine whether asymptotic theories work well. Therefore, researchers should report the number of clusters and the heterogeneity among clusters. Additionally, it implies that there will not be a universal threshold of clusters number \( G^* \) beyond which we can be assured of effective asymptotic inference. </li>
                                        <li>When the number of clusters is small or there are huge heterogeneity among clusters, the asymptotic standard errors usually fail to work effectively.</li>
                                        <li>In addition to the default asymptotic standard errors in Stata, it's always recommended to report p-values calculated using wilde bootstrap inference, especially restricted wild-cluster bootstrap (WCR).</li>
                                    </ol>
