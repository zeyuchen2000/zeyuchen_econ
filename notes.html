                        "A Practitioner's Guide to Estimation of Random‚ÄêCoefficients Logit Models of Demand" (Nevo, 2001, <em>Journal of Economics & Management Strategy</em>): Your first BLP doesn't have to be the BLP.
                        <ul>
                            <li>This paper offers a highly accessible introduction to the BLP framework, complete with sample code for solving the model. While there is now a well-established Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyblp/" target="_blank">PyBLP</a>, that implements more advanced algorithms, working through the original approach still offers valuable insight into the core principles of the BLP method and its foundational algorithm. The original paper is available at <a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1430-9134.2000.00513.x' target="_blank">[paper link]</a>. The appendix is particularly valuable as it walks through the estimation steps in detail. A copy can be found at <a href="https://www.rasmusen.org/zg601/readings/Nevo.Ras_guide_appendix.pdf" target="_blank">[appendix]</a>.</li>
                            <li>I've written a set of notes summarizing the main paper and appendix: <a href="notes/empirical_io/blp/1_1-Notes_Nevo_2000.pdf" target="_blank">[notes]</a>.</li>
                            <li>I've also replicated Nevo's MATLAB code in Python, available at <a href="notes/empirical_io/blp/1_2-Replication_Nevo_2000.zip" target="_blank">[codes]</a>. The zip file includes two data files and a Jupyter notebook file (<code>.ipynb</code>) with extensive comments to help clarify each step. For convenience, a HTML preview is provided at <a href="notes/empirical_io/blp/1_3-Code_preview.html" target="_blank">[code preview]</a>.

                        <em>Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation</em> (Train, 2009)
                        <ul>
                            <li>This book is highly valuable for researchers interested in discrete choice models, such as the mixed logit model used in the BLP framework. Professor Train has kindly made the electronic version available at <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/books/choice2.html" target="_blank">[book link]</a>.</li>
                            <li>I've written a set of notes that include Python code to implement some of the practical exercises from the book. These notes were created in Jupyter Notebook and exported to <code>.pdf</code> using Obsidian.
