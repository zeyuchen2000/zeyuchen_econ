                    <br/><p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> In decentralized environmental governance, local governments are likely to adopt the "beggar-thy-neighbor" strategy to relax regulations at boundaries. This study investigates the impact of China's Joint Atmospheric Prevention and Control Policy (JAPCP) in "2 + 26" cities enforced by the central government on pollution at provincial boundaries. The theoretical model suggests that dual incentives for environmental protection and economic growth may prompt local governments to reduce boundary pollution within the JAPCP-covered area while relocating pollution to uncovered boundaries. Based on Shandong Province data using the difference-in-differences approach, our analysis reveals a 9.6% decline in the air quality at JAPCP-covered boundaries compared to non-boundary areas and a 5.3% increase at JAPCP-uncovered boundaries, which is associated with migration of key regulated industries. Through examining annual work reports, we provide evidence that local governments modify regulatory intensity at various boundaries. These findings indicate that, while regional environmental policies are intended to promote inter-jurisdictional cooperation, the local government responses lead to unintended costs.</p>

Nonetheless, existing literature on this topic has seldom gone beyond the economic repercussions of this phenomenon. Accordingly, this study examines the relationship between domestic market integration and subjective well-being, of which very little is known. Taking China as a case, we match individual-level data from a longitudinal survey with province-level data to construct panel data and use the fixed effect model to estimate the welfare effect of market integration. Our studies suggest that market integration has a positive effect on welfare overall, contributing to approximately 11.4% of the rise in life satisfaction among Chinese residents from 2010 to 2018. In addition, we found that low-income populations had a relatively large increase in subjective well-being, which implies that market integration is a significant mechanism of redistribution and contributes to reduced happiness inequality. We also discuss the different effects of goods, labor, and capital markets, which are further impacted by heterogeneity in China's household registration (<em>hukou</em>) system and labor skills. Our findings emphasize the broader importance of reduced market segmentation and are of relevance to policymakers and stakeholders involved in economic reform.</p>

                    <br/><p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> This paper examines the impact of land titling reform on population mobility and its economic effects in China. By constructing a quantitative spatial model that incorporates an imperfect land ownership institution and a targeted allocation of urban construction land, this study finds that land titling reform facilitates significant labor migration from rural to urban areas. This migration enhances the efficiency of labor allocation and raises the average welfare of the nation's residents. However, when the supply of construction land remains unchanged, the labor mobility leads to significant regional redistribution effects, which negatively impact the urban sector. Accordingly, we assesses the alignment between the actual spatial allocation of construction land by the China's central government and the land titling reform, finding that it effectively mitigates the regional redistribution effects triggered by the reform. Furthermore, we use the structural model to simulate the optimal land allocation and observe that China's current land allocation pattern reflects a policy inclination toward regional balance, albeit at the cost of economic efficiency.</p>

                    <br/><p class="abstract"><em>Abstract:</em> Promoting the coordinated development of cities through the construction of urban agglomerations is a critical challenge for developing countries. In China's Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, the inter-city negotiation system plays a pivotal role in fostering inter-city division of labor and cross-regional mobility of resources through annual mayors' conferences and policy cooperation, thereby advancing the coordinated development of urban agglomerations. Using reduced-form estimation, we first find that the negotiation system facilitates population agglomeration, thereby promoting the convergence of real income per capita among cities. Subsequently, we construct a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model and apply the policy effects estimated in reduced-form models to assess that the negotiation system reduces the cost of population mobility between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu by 52.9%, 49.7%, and 44.9%, respectively. Welfare analysis reveals that the negotiation system enhances the welfare of residents in the YRD region and the entire country by 7.6% and 1.6%. However, the substantial inflow of population into Shanghai may lead to redistributive effects, which can be effectively managed by linking the allocation of construction land supply to changes in the resident population in each region.</p>
